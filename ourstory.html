    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
     
    <p><strong> 2 Years ago, during a family summer holidays at my mother house...</strong> <strong> When trying to find games to play with my niece Fiorella and nephew Max<strong><p>
    <p>We decided to build a castle inside their bedroom</p>
    <p>After several hours of work and game we ended with an amazing forttress</p>
    <p>Fastforward, Fiore and Max liked so much that fought with my sister to mantain the castle as they was for over a year, until we transformed into a pirate boat last summer</p>
